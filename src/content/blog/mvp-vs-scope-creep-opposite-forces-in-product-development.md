Being a solopreneur comes with unique challenges and rewards. One of the biggest challenges I constantly face is the tension between delivering a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and avoiding the trap of scope creep.

But first, let’s start with some definitions.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
When you begin defining a project, it often exists only as an idea, a vision of the end goal. At that stage, everything lives in what I like to call the Country of Fantasy. In Fantasy, the Sky is the limit. 

But to bring your project to life, you eventually need to leave Fantasy and land in the Republic of Reality. And in Reality, the two resources that seemed infinite, time and energy, suddenly become very limited.

That's where the concept of MVP comes in.

The MVP is about downsizing the expectations and focusing on delivering the **core value** of your product as quickly as possible. The primary goal is simple: validate your idea.

**Does it solve the problem you set out to address?** 

That's the essence of an MVP.

## Scope Creep

When you land in the Republic of Reality, you inevitably discover new ideas that stem from your original big vision. Many of them sound exciting, and you convince yourself they’ll make your MVP “so much better.”.

But what they really improve is the time required to implement them. This is the dangerous territory of scope creep.

Scope creep is the uncontrolled expansion of project goals and deliverables beyond the original plan. It often begins with good intentions, adding features that seem useful, but it quickly spirals out of control. The result? A project that takes longer to complete, costs more, and may ultimately fail to deliver on its initial promise.

From my own experience, the end of that road often means one thing: the project gets abandoned.

## How to beat the Scope Creep: With a real MVP 

One of the things I learnt in the pasts years, ofthen the hard way, is that the MVP is a key element for success in the early stages of a project.

I once read a quote that stuck with me:

> “If the MVP you create doesn’t totally embarrass you, you waited too long to launch.”

The meaning behind that sentence is powerful: you don’t need to strive for perfection with your MVP. Instead, you should focus on launching quickly, validating your assumptions, and pivoting based on real user feedback.

By embracing the MVP mindset you will have a perfect starting point to iterate and reach the final product more efficiently.

So whenever you start a project, remember: launch fast, learn fast, and don’t be afraid to fail.
