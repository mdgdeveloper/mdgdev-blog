In this article I will detail the process I followed to create an Azure Function that acts as a serverless API endpoint. I will cover the whole process, from designing the API to deploying and testing it to Azure.

But, first things first,

## What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other. APIs are used to enable the integration of different systems and allow them to work together.

So, in general, APIs are the means by which different software applications are able to communicate between them. In a context of client-server, the API is the layer that allows the client to interact with the data stored in a server without the need to understand the underlying implementation details.
